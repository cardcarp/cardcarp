Each command runs from the root of a dataset repo and reads and writes paths relative to it.

## In order

`cardcarp-compile` comes first, because it builds the `dist/` files every other step reads. The three after it don't depend on each other.

```sh [shell]
cardcarp-compile      # data/ + schema/         ->  dist/*.json, dist/database.json
cardcarp-sets         # dist/ + dataset.yml      ->  dist/sets.json
cardcarp-manifest     # dist/                    ->  dist/manifest.json
cardcarp-properties   # dist/ + dataset.yml      ->  dist/properties.json
```

## cardcarp-compile

The build, and the step CI runs. It checks every file under `data/` against `schema/` and stops at the first that fails, naming the file and the field. A key repeated inside one file is an error too, because YAML would otherwise keep one value and silently lose the other.

It then derives every record's id and refuses two records that claim the same one. Next it checks that every reference resolves: a card's set and oracle, a set's collection, a deck's set and every card in its list, and a format's sets, bans and exceptions. It reports all the failures together rather than one at a time. Finally it joins each card with its oracle, set and collection, works out its legality in every format, and writes `dist/database.json` alongside a file for each kind of record.

## cardcarp-sets

Writes `dist/sets.json`: the set tree, from collection type to collection to set, with a card total at each level. Collections are ordered by their first release date. Sets are ordered by index, the number first so set 9 comes before set 10, then any suffix so `01a` sits straight after `01`. Sets with no index follow, by date.

## cardcarp-manifest

Writes `dist/manifest.json`, the archive an app loads. It keys every card and deck by id, carries the id inside each record as well, and gives every card a `dir`: the path its art is published at. The file is written compact, because it's downloaded whole. See [The manifest contract](/compile/manifest).

## cardcarp-properties

Writes `dist/properties.json`: every distinct value of the card and deck fields `dataset.yml` lists. It's a reference to fill an app's filter options in from by hand, not a finished ordering.

## cardcarp-split

The inverse of `cardcarp-compile`. It rewrites `data/card`, `data/oracle`, `data/set` and `data/collection` from `dist/`, in schema field order and in the folder layout the records imply. It's for a structural change across thousands of files, and for tidying formatting after one.

It rewrites every file it owns, so run it on a clean working tree and read the diff before committing. It never touches `data/format` or `data/deck`. Both are written by hand, with comments and long text that a round trip through JSON would flatten.

## Python helpers

A game's own scripts, usually the ones that turn an upstream bulk file into `data/`, can import the helpers the pipeline itself uses:

- `to_kebab_case`, the rule every id is built with
- `card_dir`, a card's path stem
- `save_yml`, which writes YAML in the house format
- `load_schema_order` and `order_by_schema`, for writing fields in schema order

```python [python]
from cardcarp_compile import card_dir, to_kebab_case

to_kebab_case("Cynthia's Roserade")   # 'cynthias-roserade'
card_dir(record)                      # 'standard/01-base/01-base/058-pikachu'
```
